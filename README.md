# Plot_label_shiny
  
Designing a Shiny for lab use, which assists in the creation of a scatterplot, then allows the user to add labels to specific data points  
  
### Wishlist
* Allow custom gene input for accent colours instead of just clicking  
* Make ui more user friendly  
* What if a gene gets put in more than one input list?  
* Make it clear in the interface when a log transformation has been applied to the returned y-values, or convert back to original for display  
* What to do about unlabeled data points when too many overlaps?  
* Currently fixing gene list download to be a data frame of name/x/y/group
